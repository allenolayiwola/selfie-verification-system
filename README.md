  - PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM
  - Passport.js for authentication

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_database_url
   ```

4. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
